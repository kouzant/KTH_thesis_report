This chapter will present the results from the evaluation
of the project. In each section the impact of this project will be
presented in terms of cluster utilization or individual time
for a transaction to be committed in the database. The simulations were
performed with two different configurations outlined below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Six machines cluster with Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered}
  Xeon \textsuperscript{\textregistered} E5-2630 CPU and 250 GB
  RAM. The RM and RT were running on two of them and the rest were
  used by the distributed simulator. Two node MySQL Cluster NDB, with
  AMD Opteron\textsuperscript{TM} 2435 CPU and 30 GB RAM. Between the
  simulation cluster and the MySQL Cluster there is a Gigabit connection.

  Xeon \textsuperscript{\textregistered} E5-2630 CPU and 250 GB
  RAM. The RM and RT were running on two of them and the rest were
  used by the distributed simulator. Two node MySQL Cluster NDB
  running on two of the cluster machines with 10GbE network between
  the simulation cluster and the database.

\end{enumerate}

For the simulations, a distributed simulator was used which parsed
workload tracefiles for a various number of NodeManagers and created
application requests. To distribute the load, the simulators were
running on different machines and reporting back to the master.
