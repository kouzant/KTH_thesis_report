The primary goals of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Increase the cluster utilization of Hops-YARN

\item Increase the ratio of heartbeats processed by Hops-YARN
  scheduler over the total number of heartbeats received
\end{itemize}

In order to achieve the aforementioned goals, the following sub-goals
have been set:
\begin{itemize}
\item Profile the execution workflow in order to identify bottlenecks
  and hotspots

\item Minimize the pure transactional commit time to MySQL Cluster NDB

\item Parallelize the commit mechanism of Hops-YARN while at the same
  time guarantee consistency

\item Provide asynchronous API for database operations that do not invalidate the
  consistency model of Hops-YARN

\item Evaluate the performance impact of each solution
\end{itemize}
